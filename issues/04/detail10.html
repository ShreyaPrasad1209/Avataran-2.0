                    <h2>Will you be my Valentine?</h2>
                </header>
                <p> Fleeting glances, trembling lips <br>
                    Pounding heart, a head that dips <br>
                    A storm of thoughts, yet none to voice <br>
                    I watch her so, let my heart rejoice <br>
                    
                    With mustered courage, I call her name <br>
                    Take a step forward, suppressing my shame <br>
                    She turns her head, a gentle wind blows <br>
                    Our eyes meet, my cheeks emit a crimson glow <br>

                   "Speak up. Yes, it's harder than making rhymes.<br>
                    Now is your chance, stop wasting time." <br>
                    Such were the thoughts, in my head that weighed <br>
                    "Hi! There was something I wanted to say." <br>

She gave a nod and thus I began <br>
With wobbly knees and no game plan <br>
"Like fireflies add charm to a moonless night <br>
And new ideas deprecate a writer's plight" <br>

"Like a silent sea longs for a raging river <br>
And the Cupid now waits to pull an arrow from his quiver <br>
Such is the way for your love I pine <br>
Dearest of all, will you be my Valentine ?" <br>
